GMZ is an algorithm used for assessing the distribution of rainfall along a microwave link based on measurements of neighboring links, developped by Gosdshtein et al. (2009). The notebook walks the user step by step; from the correct format of the input, through the main processes taken place in GMZ, to the final product- interpolated 2D rainmaps.

The Kriging script contains functions with which kriging interpolation can be executed with path integrated data.
